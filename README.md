# bike-sharing system
> We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

We need to answer two questions for the company:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## About the Bike Sharing Dataset

### Overview

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which are composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of the important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

## Outlier Analysis

### Box plots


```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3,ncols=2)
fig.set_size_inches(15, 15)
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",orient="v",ax=axes[0][0])
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",x="mnth",orient="v",ax=axes[0][1])
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",x="weathersit",orient="v",ax=axes[1][0])
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",x="workingday",orient="v",ax=axes[1][1])
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",x="hr",orient="v",ax=axes[2][0])
sns.boxplot(data=train,y="cnt",x="temp",orient="v",ax=axes[2][1])

axes[0][0].set(ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count")
axes[0][1].set(xlabel='Month', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Months")
axes[1][0].set(xlabel='Weather Situation', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Weather Situations")
axes[1][1].set(xlabel='Working Day', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Working Day")
axes[2][0].set(xlabel='Hour Of The Day', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Hour Of The Day")
axes[2][1].set(xlabel='Temperature', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Temperature")

```




    [Text(0, 0.5, 'Count'),
     Text(0.5, 0, 'Temperature'),
     Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Box Plot On Count Across Temperature')]




![output_23_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6838540/53339788-96426a00-3907-11e9-918e-744dff9d2310.png)


__Interpretation:__ The working day and holiday box plots indicate that more bicycles are rent during normal working days than on weekends or holidays. The hourly box plots show a local maximum at 8 am and one at 5 pm which indicates that most users of the bicycle rental service use the bikes to get to work or school. Another important factor seems to be the temperature: higher temperatures lead to an increasing number of bike rents and lower temperatures not only decrease the average number of rents but also shows more outliers in the data.

### Remove outliers from data


```python
sns.distplot(train[target[-1]]);
```


![output_26_0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6838540/53339790-96db0080-3907-11e9-95a1-b986fd859bcd.png)


The distribution plot of the count values reveals that the count values do not match a normal distribution. We will use the median and interquartile range (IQR) to identify and remove outliers from the data. (An alternative approach would be the transformation of the target values to a normal distribution and using mean and standard deviation.)  


```python
print("Samples in train set with outliers: {}".format(len(train)))
q1 = train.cnt.quantile(0.25)
q3 = train.cnt.quantile(0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1
lower_bound = q1 -(1.5 * iqr) 
upper_bound = q3 +(1.5 * iqr) 
train_preprocessed = train.loc[(train.cnt >= lower_bound) & (train.cnt <= upper_bound)]
print("Samples in train set without outliers: {}".format(len(train_preprocessed)))
sns.distplot(train_preprocessed.cnt);
```

    Samples in train set with outliers: 15641
    Samples in train set without outliers: 15179
    


![output_28_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6838540/53339791-96db0080-3907-11e9-916b-184fbe301add.png)


## Correlation Analysis


```python
matrix = train[number_features + target].corr()
heat = np.array(matrix)
heat[np.tril_indices_from(heat)] = False
fig,ax= plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(20,10)
sns.heatmap(matrix, mask=heat,vmax=1.0, vmin=0.0, square=True,annot=True, cmap="Reds")
```

![output_30_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6838540/53339792-96db0080-3907-11e9-9922-9b1da0bcd734.png)


__Conclusion:__ At the end of the descriptive analysis chapter, we can note the following points:

- Casual and registered contain direct information about the bike sharing count which is to predict (data leakage). Therefore they are not considered in the feature set.
- The variables "temp" and "atemp" are strongly correlated. To reduce the dimensionality of the predictive model, the feature "atemp" is dismissed.
- The variables "hr" and "temp" seem to be promising features for the bike sharing count prediction.



```python
features.remove('atemp')
```

## Overview Metrics

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE = $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - y_i)^2}$

### Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

RMSLE = $\sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\log(x_i) - \log(y_i))^2 }$

### $R^2$ Score

$R^2=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$

## Model Selection

The characteristics of the given problem are:

- __Regression:__ The target variable is a quantity.
- __Small dataset:__ Less than 100K samples.
- __Few features should be important:__ The correlation matrix indicates that a few features contain the information to predict the target variable.

This characteristic makes the following methods most promising: Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Ensemble Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.

We will evaluate the performance of these models in the following:


```python
x_train = train_preprocessed[features].values
y_train = train_preprocessed[target].values.ravel()
# Sort validation set for plots
val = val.sort_values(by=target)
x_val = val[features].values
y_val = val[target].values.ravel()
x_test = test[features].values

table = PrettyTable()
table.field_names = ["Model", "Mean Squared Error", "R² score"]

models = [
    SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3),
    Lasso(alpha=0.1),

    RandomForestRegressor( random_state=0, n_estimators=300)
]

for model in models:
    model.fit(x_train, y_train) 
    y_res = model.predict(x_val)

    mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_res)
    score = model.score(x_val, y_val)
